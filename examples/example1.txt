EXAMPLE 1:

In this example we are demonstrating the use of the pragma tuner 'explore' alongside with 'max_abs_error' which,
in this case, optimizes a 'for' cycle to step with the most efficient value, while retaining the maximum absolute error
in the boundary specified by the pragma 'max_abs_error'.
 
The file test1.c was used to generate this code.
