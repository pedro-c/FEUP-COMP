EXAMPLE 2:

In this example we are demonstrating the use of the pragma tuner 'explore' alongside with 'is_positive' which,
in this case, optimizes a 'for' cycle to step with the most efficient value while mantaining the value of the 'acc'
positive, as specified by the pragma 'is_positive'.

The file test2.c was used to generate this code.
