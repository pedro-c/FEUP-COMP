EXAMPLE 3:

In this example we are demonstrating the use of the pragma tuner 'explore' alongside with 'is_negative' which,
in this case, optimizes a for cycle to step with the most efficient value while mantaining the value of the 'acc'
negative, as specified by the pragma 'is_negative'. In this case, the 'acc' variable is never negative and, as such,
there is no valid code to be generated.

File test3.c used to generate this code.

Variable var never fulfills the pragma condition.
